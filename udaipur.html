<h2 class="h">Jag Mandir</h2>
<p class="p">
Jag Mandir sits on an island by Lake Pichola. The royal family of Rajasthan used this palace as a summer resort, or a location to arrange parties. The history of the palace is a mixture of Rajput and Mughal – it was used as a sanctum by the Mughal Prince Khurram before he was Shah Jahan. It is an excellent example of history.
